        <rdfs:comment>Liver function tests (also called LFTs) are blood tests that can provide information about how the liver is working. They test the levels of a number of proteins and enzymes that are either produced by liver cells or released into the blood when liver cells are damaged.

        <rdfs:comment>A thyroxine test is a blood test that helps diagnose thyroid conditions. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of your throat. Your thyroid makes hormones that control the way your body uses energy. These hormones affect your weight, heart, body temperature, muscle strength, and even your mood.

        <rdfs:comment>TSH stands for “thyroid stimulating hormone” and the test measures how much of this hormone is in your blood. A TSH test is done to find out if your thyroid gland is working the way it should. It can tell you if it’s overactive (hyperthyroidism) or underactive (hypothyroidism). The test can also detect a thyroid disorder before you have any symptoms.
